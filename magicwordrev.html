<div id="magic" style="font-size: 20px;">This was a magic word exercise that one of the Udemy instructors used for a JavaScript example. I tried to duplicate it for another exercise later and made a fatal mistake of missing a key item. I looked at the new version that I had tried to do for literally an hour and a half before I found out WHY the dang thing would not work. Since I changed the wording of the variables, I had written the the wrong if statement(?). One of those &ldquo;O*M*G&rdquo; moments for certain.
